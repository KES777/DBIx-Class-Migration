=head1 NAME

DBIx::Class::Migration::Tutorial::ThirdMigration - A more advanced database change

=head1 GOAL

In the last version we added a new table C<country> and enforced a one to many
relationship between C<country> and C<artist> such that every C<artist> belonged
to a single C<country>  These types of database changes, when you add a table
and some columns, tend to be some the easier types of migrations to perform.

Lets take on a more complicated migration problem, and add some more fixture
configurations and seed data.  This time we will add a table and change the
nature of an existing relationship.  Is L<DBIx::Class::Migration> up to the
job?  Let's find out!

=head1 The New Business Requirement

In version 1 and 2 the relationship between Artist and CD is one to many; for
each Artist there are zero to many CDs, and for each Cd there is one and only
one artist.  Now we realize that a CD could have a bunch of Artists working
together as a collaboration.  We need to change our database to reflect this
need, and we additionally need to migrate our existing data to this new schema
Let's get to it!

=head1 Change your Schema

Let's make the Version 3 schema.  We need to to add a Bridge class between
Artist and Cd so that we can express the idea of 'many to many'.

    touch lib/MusicBase/Schema/Result/ArtistCd.pm

And then open that in your text editor, enter the following code:

    package MusicBase::Schema::Result::ArtistCd;
    use base qw/DBIx::Class::Core/;

    __PACKAGE__->table('artist_cd');
    __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
      artist_fk => {
        data_type => 'integer',
      },
      cd_fk => {
        data_type => 'integer',
      });

    __PACKAGE__->set_primary_key('artist_fk','cd_fk');

    __PACKAGE__->belongs_to(
      'artist' => "MusicBase::Schema::Result::Artist",
      {'foreign.artist_id'=>'self.artist_fk'});

    __PACKAGE__->belongs_to(
      'cd' => 'MusicBase::Schema::Result::Cd',
      {'foreign.cd_id'=>'self.cd_fk'});

    1;

So if you are familiar with L<DBIx::Class> you'll already know this is the
classic pattern.  We have a bridge table where each row points to one Artist
and on CD row, and no duplications are allowed (the Same Artist can't be linked
to the same CD twice, for example).

Now we need to change the Artist and CD Result classes.  Open your editor on
C<lib/MusicBase/Schema/Result/Artist.pm>:

    package MusicBase::Schema::Result::Artist;
    use base qw/DBIx::Class::Core/;

    __PACKAGE__->table('artist');

    __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
      artist_id => {
        data_type => 'integer',
      },
      country_fk => {
        data_type => 'integer',
      },
      name => {
        data_type => 'varchar',
        size => '96',
      });

    __PACKAGE__->set_primary_key('artist_id');

    __PACKAGE__->belongs_to(
      'has_country' => 'MusicBase::Schema::Result::Country',
      {'foreign.country_id'=>'self.country_fk'});

    __PACKAGE__->has_many(
      'artist_cd_rs' => 'MusicBase::Schema::Result::ArtistCd',
      {'foreign.artist_fk'=>'self.artist_id'});

    __PACKAGE__->many_to_many(artist_cds => artist_cd_rs => 'cd');

    1;

So we didn't change the columns, but we removed the direct relationship to Cd
and replaced it with a relationship to the new ArtistCd result class.  We also
created one pseudo 'many to many' relationship across the bridge so that we can
directly pick up all the Cds for a given Artist.

Now we need to change the Cd.  Open C<lib/MusicBase/Schema/Result/Cd.pm>
and make the following change:

    package MusicBase::Schema::Result::Cd;
    use base qw/DBIx::Class::Core/;

    __PACKAGE__->table('cd');
    __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
      'cd_id' => {
        data_type => 'integer',
      },
      'title' => {
        data_type => 'varchar',
        size => '96',
      });

    __PACKAGE__->set_primary_key('cd_id');

    __PACKAGE__->has_many(
      'track_rs' => 'MusicBase::Schema::Result::Track',
      {'foreign.cd_fk'=>'self.cd_id'});

    __PACKAGE__->has_many(
      'artist_cd_rs' => 'MusicBase::Schema::Result::ArtistCd',
      {'foreign.cd_fk'=>'self.cd_id'});

    __PACKAGE__->many_to_many(artists_cd => artist_cd_rs => 'artist');

    1;

Changes here are a bit deeper.  First we removed the C<artist_fk> column since
we no longer constrain each Cd to a single Artist.  Then we removed the 
relationship directly to Artist (since we no longer have that) and replaced it
with a new relationship C<artist_cd_rs> which connects us to the ArtistCD
bridge table.  Last, we added another pseudo relationship so that you can
easily cross the bridge table and get all the Artists related to a given Cd.

As always, you should remember to up the C<$VERSION> in your
C<MusicBase::Schema>:

    package MusicBase::Schema;
    use base 'DBIx::Class::Schema';

    our $VERSION = 3;

    __PACKAGE__->load_namespaces();

    1;

Very good, we've changed the database to reflect our new requirement.  Lets
start working on the migration.

=head2 Prepare the migrations

    dbic-migration -Ilib status
    Schema is 3
    Deployed database is 2

So first off we've check the status of our system and can see the database is
one version behind.  Let's prepare the migration:

    dbic-migration -Ilib prepare

And as usually we can see a bunch of new version 3 directories and some 2-3
directories related to upgrades.  As in the previous migration, we'll skip
the 3-2 downgrade, instead covering downgrades in a later section.  Here's
some of the new directory structure:

    /share
      /fixtures
        /1
          (Same as before)
        /2
          (Same as before)
        /3
          /conf
            all_tables.json
            countries.json
      /migrations
        /_common
          (Same as before)
        /_source
          (System files for DBIC::DeploymentHandler)
        /SQLite
          /deploy
            /1
              (Same as before)
            /2
              (Same as before)
            /3
              001-auto-_VERSION.sql
              001-auto.sql
          /downgrade
            /2-1
            /3-2
          /upgrade
            /1-2
              (Same as before)
            /2-3
              001-auto.sql
      musicbase-schema.db

At this point there should be no surprises.  You'll notice that C<prepare>
made a fresh C<all_tables.json> for you, which has added your new bridge table
and it also copied over your custom C<countries.json> from the previous version.
Please note that this is a dumb copy; no attempt has been made to convert the
configuration to make sense with any database structural changes.  You'll need
to examine your custom configurations and manually make any needed changes.  In
this case the existing custom configuration is fine for this version, so we can
move on to reviewing the deploy and upgrades.

There should be no surprises under C<deploy/3/*>.  The only reason you'll need
to poke into these files is if you need to see the full DLL as part of helping
you craft the upgrades correctly, or if your DBA needs to tweak aspects of the
design (change indexes, storage engines, etc.)

The real fun begins under C<share/migrations/SQLite/upgrade/2-3/*>.  Again you
have the C<001-auto.sql> file, which is the first, best guess on how to upgrade
the database.  We need to poke into that and shape it into something that can
work for both our database structure and our data.  Let's look at the the 
suggestion.  Open  C<share/migrations/SQLite/upgrade/2-3/001-auto.sql> in your
text editor:

    BEGIN;

    CREATE TABLE artist_cd (
      artist_fk integer NOT NULL,
      cd_fk integer NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (artist_fk, cd_fk),
      FOREIGN KEY(artist_fk) REFERENCES artist(artist_id),
      FOREIGN KEY(cd_fk) REFERENCES cd(cd_id)
    );

    CREATE INDEX artist_cd_idx_artist_fk ON artist_cd (artist_fk);

    CREATE INDEX artist_cd_idx_cd_fk ON artist_cd (cd_fk);

    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE cd_temp_alter (
      cd_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
      title varchar(96) NOT NULL
    );

    INSERT INTO cd_temp_alter SELECT cd_id, title FROM cd;

    DROP TABLE cd;

    CREATE TABLE cd (
      cd_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
      title varchar(96) NOT NULL
    );

    INSERT INTO cd SELECT cd_id, title FROM cd_temp_alter;

    DROP TABLE cd_temp_alter;

    COMMIT;

This doesn't look too bad.  From first review it looks to me like we are just
missing transfering data from the old relationship to the new bridge table.  So
like last time we will bust this up into a few steps, under new file names but
under this directory.  Lets handle this in bits.

    touch share/migrations/SQLite/upgrade/2-3/001-create_artist_cd.sql

And then open that in your editor.  We will copy the first bit of the
C<001-auto.sql>, having to do with creating the new table and indexes over:

    BEGIN;

    CREATE TABLE artist_cd (
      artist_fk integer NOT NULL,
      cd_fk integer NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (artist_fk, cd_fk),
      FOREIGN KEY(artist_fk) REFERENCES artist(artist_id),
      FOREIGN KEY(cd_fk) REFERENCES cd(cd_id)
    );

    CREATE INDEX artist_cd_idx_artist_fk ON artist_cd (artist_fk);
    CREATE INDEX artist_cd_idx_cd_fk ON artist_cd (cd_fk);

    COMMIT;

Now we need to populate that with existing data:

    touch share/migrations/SQLite/upgrade/2-3/002-populate_artist_cd.sql

Here's the SQL to enter:

    ;
    BEGIN;

    INSERT INTO artist_cd(artist_fk,cd_fk) select artist_fk,cd_id FROM cd;

    COMMIT;

Luckily everything we need exists in the current C<cd> table, so this is a
straightup insert.  In this case I didn't use a Perl deploy run script since
I felt the performance benefit of a native SQL approach outweighed the
advantage of database portability.  If I ever needed to make this work on say
MySQL or Pg, I'd need to rewrite it, and there's not a lot of SQL so I am
willing to take that risk.

Lastly, we need to alter the C<cd> table to get rid of the now unneeded
relationship:

    touch share/migrations/SQLite/upgrade/2-3/003-alter_cd.sql

Then open that in your text editor, and lets bring over the last part from
C<001-auto.sql>:

    BEGIN;

    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE cd_temp_alter (
      cd_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
      title varchar(96) NOT NULL
    );

    INSERT INTO cd_temp_alter SELECT cd_id, title FROM cd;

    DROP TABLE cd;

    CREATE TABLE cd (
      cd_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
      title varchar(96) NOT NULL
    );

    INSERT INTO cd SELECT cd_id, title FROM cd_temp_alter;

    DROP TABLE cd_temp_alter;

    COMMIT;

Again, since SQLite doesn't have any DDL alter to remove FK's we need to
roundtrip the data via a temporary table.  If you had a million+ rows you
might worry about this approach :)  Again, I will accept this DDL change for
the scope of our limited requirement

So, that's all the changes.  Like last time, remember to remove the suggested
upgrade script:

    rm share/migrations/SQLite/upgrade/2-3/001-auto.sql

And you'd probably wish to commit these files now if you are using an source
control system (and if you are not, prepare for pain!)

Next step will be to perform the upgrade.

=head1 Upgrade your database.

    $ dbic-migration -Ilib status
    Schema is 3
    Deployed database is 2

SO the database is in the expected state.  If you've been messing with the data
you might which to 'clean' things up, with something like:

    $ dbic-migration -Ilib delete_table_rows
    $ dbic-migration -Ilib populate
    Reading configurations from /Users/johnn/Desktop/MusicBase/share/fixtures/2/conf
    Restored set all_tables to database

As you might notice above, even though the schema is version two, we installed
fixtures from version one.  The tool will always try to match fixture populates
to the current database version.

Let's go ahead with the upgrade:

    $ dbic-migration -Ilib upgrade
    $ dbic-migration -Ilib status
    Schema is 3
    Deployed database is 3

Looks good.  Lets peek in the database and do a quick sanity check.  You should
also consider writing some test cases similar to what we did in the previous
section:

    $sqlite3 share/musicbase-schema.db

    SQLite version 3.7.5
    Enter ".help" for instructions
    Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"

    sqlite> .tables
    artist                  country                              
    artist_cd               dbix_class_deploymenthandler_versions
    cd                      track  

    sqlite> select * from artist_cd;
    1|1
    1|2
    2|3

    sqlite> .q

So that looks pretty good.  Normally at this point you'd be getting ready to
dump fixtures but then...

=head2 Requirementa Change!  Mistakes Happen!

Just about when you are finished there is a sudden requirement change to the
version.  Or maybe you realize your new schema isn't exactly what you need.  In
any case you find yourself in a situation where you've already updated and now
you need to step back, change the migration, and upgrade again.

This really isn't a problem at all.  Its actually very easy to step back and
redo your version.  You could handle this in two ways.  Either you've been very
good and making sure you made good downgrades (we didn't :) ) or you can force
install the database to an arbitrary older version and start again with the
C<prepare> command.  We will take this second option for this tutorial, and I
will cover downgrades as a special example later.

So for the purposes of our tutorial, lets say that suddenly we realize our
design for the C<country> table is terrible wrong.  We've been putting real
country names in the table, and in English, but now we want to internationalize
our site.  That means we should avoid english words in our seed data, and
instead use normalized codes that our UI layer can use and leverage existing
internationalization and localization tools against.  So we need to change that
country table, and do so in a way to make sure we keep our existing country
information correct.  Lastly, we want to add a few new countries to the list
as well as one more artist to the system.  Thats a bunch of changes, so lets
get to it!
