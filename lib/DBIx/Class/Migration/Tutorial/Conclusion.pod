A quite recap and thoughts about where to go next.

Nice to see you get this far!  I hope you now have the basic understanding
needed to be able to integrate migrations into your DBIC workflow, testing
and web development.  The next bit is up to you.  Use the tools, think about
where the gaps are, and give me some feedback.  Hopefully over time this
tutorial can become better and we can also start to create some basic recipes
for good approachs to common problems.  Thanks!
